1) git config is used to configrate and identify who you are to set the default identity
that makes you able to push files to remote
for example: git config --global user.email "email@ddd.com" is used to enter your email
	     git config --global user.name "name" is used to identify your name


2) git init is used to initialize a new local empty repository which means that it will be created
in the main or in the same defined path in the cmd and it will creates a folder called ".git"


3) git merge takes the updated branchs or copies and collect them in one single branch.


4) git remote is responsible for all interactions with other remote repositories that makes you able to view, 
create and delete connections with other repos
